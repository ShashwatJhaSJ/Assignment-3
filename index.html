              <p>
                Butter chicken or murg makhaniis a dish, originating in the Indian subcontinent, of chicken in a mildly spiced tomato sauce.
                Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste.The chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and onion-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is finally velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and is finally garnished with coriander.
                
Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.
Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.
The dish was developed in 1947 by founders of Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The dish was made "by chance" by mixing the leftover chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter and cream.[10] In 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh Makhani" (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The dish is common in India and many other countries

              <p>
                Paneer tikka is an Indian dish made from chunks of paneer marinated in spices and grilled in a tandoor.It is a vegetarian alternative to chicken tikka and other meat dishes.It is a popular dish that is widely available in India and countries with an Indian diaspora.
                Chunks of paneer, a type of fresh cheese, are marinated in spices and are then arranged on a stick with capsicums, onions and tomatoes. These sticks are grilled in a tandoor and the dish is thereafter served hot, seasoned with lemon juice and chaat masala.[8] It is sometimes accompanied by salad or mint chutney.[9] Tikka dishes traditionally go well with mint chutney.[10] The paneer, though tender, has a crisp singe on the surface.When paneer tikka is served with a gravy, it is called paneer tikka masala.[12] It is also served as with a wrap, paneer tikka roll, where the paneer tikka is wrapped into an Indian bread and served.[1][13] A variant of paneer tikka is also made as a kebab.[14]

                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
Sushi , stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers.
Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi  for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation.The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became  in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
